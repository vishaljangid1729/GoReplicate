([https://GoReplicate](https://github.com/vishaljangid1729/GoReplicate))

## Overview

GoReplicate is an open-source GoLang project that provides a user-friendly wrapper on top of the HashiCorp Raft library for building distributed systems that require data or action replication across multiple servers. Whether replicating database transactions, making API calls, or handling RPC requests, GoReplicate simplifies building reliable and consistent distributed applications.

## Features

- Easy-to-use API for submitting commands and handling replication.
- Robust leader election and log replication using HashiCorp Raft.
- Customizable state machine for executing replicated commands and producing desired outcomes.
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms.
- Support for client-side waiting and notifications for replicated command execution.
- Extensive documentation and examples for quick integration.
